The Apriori algorithm uses frequent itemsets to generate association rules, and it is designed to work on the databases that contain transactions. With the help of these association rule, it determines how strongly or how weakly two objects are connected.  Frequent itemsets are those items whose support is greater than the threshold value or user-specified minimum support. It means if A &amp; B are the frequent itemsets together, then individually A and B should also be the frequent itemset.  Suppose there are the two transactions: A= {1,2,3,4,5}, and B= {2,3,7}, in these two transactions, 2 and 3 are the frequent itemsets. In this project the transactions of a store is noted for a week and apriori algorithm is used to make frequent item data so that a proper decision can be taken regarding those items which helps to make better offers for the customers which helps in increasing profit for the store.
